Game server Example
=========================
## Description

This is implementation of Game Server for card games. (see TASK.md)

## Features
- Implementing 2 games with rules as described.
- UI client is ready and work.
- Multi-tabling is done. UI support up to 4 concurrent games. Server has no limit for concurrent games
- Player has limitations for making action (20 sec). After this it makes auto Fold
- Player can reconnect to server and running games (it can be done to any state: waiting opponent or performing action). Can be test this by refresh page and click connect button again
- Bot (for single game) is implemented with different strategies. It start by default and can be configured (see Params)
- Persist player balance during restarting.
